  abstract = {This paper has been prepared by the Symphony collaboration (University of Warsaw, Uniwersytet Jagielloński, DESY/CNR and ICFO) on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the ‘simple man’s models’ which underlie most of the phenomena that occur when intense ultrashort laser pulses interact with matter. The phenomena in question include high-harmonic generation (HHG), above-threshold ionization (ATI), and non-sequential multielectron ionization (NSMI). ‘Simple man’s models’ provide both an intuitive basis for understanding the numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the motivation for the powerful analytic approximations generally known as the strong field approximation (SFA). In this paper we first review the SFA in the form developed by us in the last 25 years. In this approach the SFA is a method to solve the TDSE, in which the non-perturbative interactions are described by including continuum–continuum interactions in a systematic perturbation-like theory. In this review we focus on recent applications of the SFA to HHG, ATI and NSMI from multi-electron atoms and from multi-atom molecules. The main novel part of the presented theory concerns generalizations of the SFA to: (i) time-dependent treatment of two-electron atoms, allowing for studies of an interplay between electron impact ionization and resonant excitation with subsequent ionization; (ii) time-dependent treatment in the single active electron approximation of ‘large’ molecules and targets which are themselves undergoing dynamics during the HHG or ATI processes. In particular, we formulate the general expressions for the case of arbitrary molecules, combining input from quantum chemistry and quantum dynamics. We formulate also theory of time-dependent separable molecular potentials to model analytically the dynamics of realistic electronic wave packets for molecules in strong laser fields. We dedicate this work to the memory of Bertrand Carré, who passed away in March 2018 at the age of 60.},

  abstract = {We consider tunnel ionization of an atom or molecule in a strong field within an analytical treatment of the R-matrix method, in which an imaginary boundary is set up inside the classically forbidden region that acts as a source of ionized electrons. These electrons are then propagated in the semiclassical approximation, and relying on a numerical solution of the inner region, which is accessible using quantum chemical techniques, we describe the subsequent evolution of the ionized electron and the ionic core. Importantly, we show that correlation interactions between the ionized electrons and those left behind in the core can play a role during ionization, and that interactions can occur while the electron is still inside the classically forbidden region that enable tunnelling from channels normally subject to far greater exponential suppression since they are subject to higher and wider tunnelling barriers. This interaction can be described analytically using saddle-point methods that find the dominant contributions to the temporal, spatial and momentum integrals that make up the expressions for the ionization yield. However, these methods yield results for the angular distributions of the ionized electron that do not necessarily match experiment and which yield physically unsatisfactory solutions. In this report we develop a formalism to evaluate these integrals exactly, which yields more precise calculations of the angular distributions while at the same time providing the language, in terms of exchange of angular momentum, with which to understand their origins and their differences from previous cases, thus giving an insight into the fundamental physics of the correlation interaction process.},

Lett. 71, 1994 (1993)] and clearly explains why the single-atom harmonic-generation spectra fall off at an energy approximately equal to the ionization energy plus about three times the oscillation energy of a free electron in the field. The theory is valid for arbitrary atomic potentials and can be generalized to describe laser fields of arbitrary ellipticity and spectrum. We discuss the role of atomic dipole matrix elements, electron rescattering processes, and of depletion of the ground state. We present the exact quantum-mechanical formula for the harmonic cutoff that differs from the phenomenological law 𝐼𝑝+3.17𝑈𝑝, where 𝐼𝑝 is the atomic ionization potential and 𝑈𝑝 is the ponderomotive energy, due to the account for quantum tunneling and diffusion effects.},

  abstract = {From the famous classical "simple man" model to the recent multichannel model for polyatomic molecules, this tutorial will guide you through the several landmarks in our understanding of high harmonic generation and high harmonic spectroscopy. Our goal was to provide recipes and insights for modelling the harmonic response in various regimes, from the single active electron regime typical for noble gas atoms to the laser-driven attosecond hole dynamics in polyatomics. We have tried to pay particular attention to both simple recipes and their limitations, including the connection of real-valued classical and complex-valued quantum times and velocities. In addition to physical pictures, general approaches and their practical realizations, we have also tried to discuss some of the sticky technical issues, such as the possibility to factorize high harmonic response into the three steps of ionization, propagation and recombination and practical ways to treat strong field ionization, search for the saddle points of multi-dimensional integrals, deal with poles arising in the quantum-mechanical integrands, remove divergences appearing in approximate saddle point expressions, etc.},

The plasma current thus generated varies on the same fast time scale and is responsible for harmonic generation.

This Colloquium covers the control of high-harmonic spectra by temporal and spatial pulse shaping of the driving laser pulses and its implications on time-resolved XUV spectroscopy and attosecond pulse shaping. It summarizes important steps for extending existing pulse shaping techniques and control schemes from the near-infrared or visible part to shorter wavelengths. Using adaptive pulse shaping of the driving laser pulses, several groups have demonstrated control of the high-harmonic spectrum, including the author’s work on the complete control over the XUV spectrum of high-order harmonics, generated in a gas-filled hollow fiber. It is possible to achieve both the enhancement and the suppression of single or several selected harmonic orders. These arbitrarily shaped soft-x-ray spectra will allow for important modifications of the resulting harmonic pulses in the temporal domain. This constitutes first steps towards direct attosecond pulse shaping in the soft-x-ray domain. Moreover, high-harmonic generation in a hollow-core fiber can be enhanced by coupling into a single fiber mode using a feedback-controlled adaptive two-dimensional spatial light modulator.},
